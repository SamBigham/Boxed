#**Important**
In order to run the code, you need to open it up from the src directory on VScode and add the jUnit testing library to the classpath. Otherwise, VScode will not be able to recoqnize the Junit imports.

Parts of this code was taken from a lab whose original author was Sam Rebelsky

This lab is about Boxed blocks and truncating them, and doing other commands with them.

A lab on polymorphism, based on an old lab from _The Tao of Java_, itself
based on an even older lab from _Espresso_.  Old labs never die; they just
get recycled.
